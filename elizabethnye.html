	<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Elizabeth Nye is a DPhil student in Social Intervention with the University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Intervention.   She is a Clarendon Scholar and a member of St. Catherine's College.  Before coming to Oxford in 2012, Elizabeth was a special education teacher for students with emotional/behavioral and cognitive disabilities.  As a teacher, she collaborated with school psychologists, social workers, foster care workers, crisis management teams, and other clinicians to support her students' development.  Elizabeth's research experience is varied and includes psychological studies with undergraduates at university and adolescents in juvenile detention as well as educational studies with primary school students.</p>
		<p>Elizabeth's current research focuses on the emotional, behavioral, and academic development of children, particularly those with identified special needs or who are at-risk.  She studies school-based programs and teacher classroom management strategies in an effort to support children's mental health needs, decrease classroom aggression, and promote peaceful conflict resolution strategies.</p>
